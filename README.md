# API

My program makes use of node.js and mongoose.

This is a basic api with CRUD functionality using MongoDB Atlas cloud service as the database.
This is for a hypothetical online phone store to support their web store for purchases.
This is purely backend with no front end to support it.

It has a CLI to navigate the program.
The CLI will close after a task is complete.
This is due to some issue I was running into with prompt which kept carrying the input from the user
on to other future queries.

Reference the schemas for the data models used for the user, phones and transactions.
In the program you are not prompted for specfic details as you input them.
So unfortuntately if you want to input correct data, you will have to beforehand
know how and when to input the data in order.
Sorry for the inconvience.
